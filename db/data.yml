      to say a few <a class="f-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ninersnation.com/2014/5/2/5676240/colin-kaepernick-miami-suspicious-incident-comments-turlock-prayer-breakfast">words</a>  to
      fans, the media, and that big Niner in the sky, Jesus Christ, at a California
      prayer breakfast on Friday morning:<br><br><em>"It''s been put out that I did
      something wrong. Even though it''s a bad circumstance, a bad situation, I feel
      like ultimately I''ve been blessed because it''s changed my way of thinking.
      It''s made me stronger. It''s made me look at things differently."        </em></span></p><p><span><em>"Even this morning, this is a blessing. It makes
      me very happy to know that people are staying behind me the way they have."<br></em><br>Truly,
      Kaepernick insisted, that naked woman who nearly died has been a great blessing.
      God put her there, drugged and unresponsive to medical professionals, unsure
      if a sexual assault had taken place, too afraid to release her name for fear
      of a rabid, sensationalist media and the vitriol of millions of football fans
      eager to take to anonymous message boards to call her a gold digging whore,
      to make him stronger, because, as one of the nation’s top athletes, he often
      has difficulty with strength. He cannot wait for all the future blessings God
      has planned to increase his strength: maybe he’ll back over a puppy with his
      car when he’s adjusting the radio instead of using the rearview or perhaps the
      next girl he brings to his hotel will have a drug-induced seizure, convulsing
      helplessly before him, reaching out a trembling hand in her final moments of
      life, pleading with her eyes for human connection, one he is unwilling or unable
      to ultimately give. Maybe next time will haunt him for the rest of his life.
      Maybe he’ll see this next dying naked woman’s fading light in the laughter of
      his first born son, his future wife’s sleepy smiles, and know the fleeting,
      fragile nature of this life. He hopes if that happens, it will increase his
      upper body strength because his quads are pretty good for the time being. <br><br>“I
      just can’t wait to see what other blessings Christ our Lord has in store,” Kaepernick
      reckoned in front of a smiling crowd. <br><br>When asked for comment, God replied,
      “I don’t even know anymore, man.” <br><br>No word on whether or not the woman
      who was hospitalized after drinking and drugging with Kaepernick feels equally
      blessed, but she can’t throw a football, so it’s not like she’s even real. <br><br></span></p>'
